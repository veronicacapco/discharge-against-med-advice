### Abstract
This project explores trends in patient discharge rates (against medical advice) and patient readmission rates (after discharge against medical advice) during years 2019-2020 in California. The datasets used in this project contain information about patients who left the hospital against medical advice, which means they chose to leave before their physician recommended discharge, and readmission rates based on discharges against medical advice and discharges not aaginst medical advice. Patients who left against medical advice may be exposed to higher risks which may result in readmission due to incomplete treatment of their medical issues. The readmission rates for 2020 would be particularly interesting because of the COVID-19 pandemic which was happening that year. Using SAS Studio, I analyzed both datasets to see patterns and possible correlations between the data.
